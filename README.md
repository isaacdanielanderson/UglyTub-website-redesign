# UglyTub-website-redesign
Redesign of http://www.uglytub.com 

Hello there. This is a school project for a UI course. This project is based around a hilariously bad website named uglytub. 

I have redesigned the logo, picked colors, and did a complete rework of the homepage. This site is built on Bootstrap 3 and I used SASS as
a precompiler for my CSS.
